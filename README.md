# spam-classification
Machine learning-based spam filtering approaches have been applied with success to automatically classify spam and non-spam emails.

Flair is a library for state-of-the-art NLP developed by Zalando Research. Itâ€™s built in Python on top of the PyTorch framework. 
Flair allows for the application of state-of-the-art NLP models to text, such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (PoS), sense disambiguation, and classification.
It is multilingual and allows you to use and combine different word and document embeddings, including the BERT embeddings, ELMo embeddings, and their proposed Flair embeddings. In addition, Flair allows you to train your own language model, targeted to your language or domain, and apply it to the downstream task.
